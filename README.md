## Notes
I used the Rest Countries API to showcase how virtual scrolling can be applied in an Angular app. Initially, it was challenging to find countries with similar names, so I decided to start searching from the second letter of the country name to increase the chances of finding related results.

Throughout this project, I aimed to utilize as many Angular concepts as possible to demonstrate how I architected the app and leveraged key Angular features.
